			<h2> Think Global's Purpose </h2>
			
				<p> Think Global is a pioneer in the field of experiential international exchanges. We have led over 5,000 students on immersive and transformative experiences abroad. 
				<p> Our primary purpose is to raise cultural awareness about differences between people's beliefs and religion through educational and cultural exchange programmes for students. These programmes are designed to present the opportunity to understand and learn various societal and cultural aspects of different nations. Through the programmes, students can develop themselves through cross-cultural experiences abroad while working towards education or a cause important to themselves for personal and professional development. 
				<p> The core values of Think Global are acceptance, respect and appreciation of the cultural diversity that exists around the world. Think Global's vision is a world where everyone is accepting of others and their rights to live in peace regardless of beliefs, cultures, identify or way of life.
